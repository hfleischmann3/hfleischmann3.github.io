      <h4>About Me</h4>
    </p>
    I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University, advised by <a href="https://q3r.github.io/" target="_blank">Jason Li</a>.
      <p>
        While I am broadly interested in theoretical computer science and combinatorics, I am particularly passionate
      about graph algorithms and extremal problems in discrete geometry, additive combinatorics, and graph theory.
      <hr>
      <p>
        I graduated from the University of Michigan in 2023, majoring in mathematics and computer science.  During the 2023â€“2024 academic year I completed Part III of the Mathematical Tripos at the University of Cambridge,
          passing with Distinction and earning a Master of Advanced Study, funded by a <a href = "https://www.churchillscholarship.org/the-scholarship"
          target = "_blank">Churchill Scholarship</a>. My Part III Essay was on <a href="Part_III_Essay.pdf" target="_blank">Sharp Thresholds for Ramsey Properties,</a> supervised by
          <a href = "https://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/~jdrs2/"> Julian Sahasrabudhe</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
      During the summer of 2023, I was a graduate mentor at the 2023 DIMACS REU program, working with <a href="http://karthikcs.org/" target="_blank">  Karthik C.S.</a>
      and his students (<a href="http://reu.dimacs.rutgers.edu/~ap2518/" target="_blank">Ashwin Padaki</a>,
     <a href ="https://www.styopa.space/" target="_blank"> Styopa Zharkov</a>, and <a href = "http://reu.dimacs.rutgers.edu/~kk1317/" target = "_blank"> Kyrylo Karlov</a>) on hardness of approximation of clustering objectives.
      I also mentored the students in his other project (<a href = "http://reu.dimacs.rutgers.edu/~gg730/" target="_blank">Guillermo Gamboa</a>, <a href = "http://reu.dimacs.rutgers.edu/~jm2972/" target = "_blank"> Josef Mat&#x011B;jka</a>,
         and <a href = "http://reu.dimacs.rutgers.edu/~jp2274/" target="_blank">Jakub Petr</a>), constructing optimal Euclidean Steiner trees for the regular simplex.
      </p>
      <p>
      I did my honors thesis with <a href="https://bodwin.engin.umich.edu/"> Greg Bodwin</a> at the University of Michigan, devising sublinear time algorithms for
      constructing adjacency oracles of sparse spanning subgraphs, $k$-connectivity oracles, and multiplicative distance spanners. We also showed several lower bounds
      for our model. This <a href = "https://drops.dagstuhl.de/entities/document/10.4230/LIPIcs.ITCS.2024.19" target = "_blank">work</a> has since been published in ITCS 2024.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the summer of 2022, I was an REU student at the DIMACS REU program, working with <a href="http://karthikcs.org/" target="_blank">  Karthik C.S.</a> and his
        student <a href = "https://phantom.cs.qc.cuny.edu/gavva" target = "_blank"> Surya Teja Gavva</a> on inapproximability of the Steiner Tree problem. The
        <a href = "https://epubs.siam.org/doi/10.1137/1.9781611977912.67" target = "_blank">work</a> resultant from this project has since been published in SODA 2024.
      </p>
      <p>
      During the 2021 and 2022 academic years, I worked on quantifying the fairness of the redistricting plans
      drawn in the new redistricting cycle. I began as a student researcher in <a href = "https://lsa.umich.edu/math/undergraduates/research-and-career-opportunities/LoGM.html">
      LoG(M) </a>, advised by <a href = "https://sites.google.com/view/tim-ryan-math/home"> Tim Ryan </a> and <a href = "https://www.samuelhansen.com/#about-me"> Samuel Hansen</a>.
      With LoG(M), I developed a <a href = "https://gitlab.eecs.umich.edu/logm/wi21/gerrymandering-visualization/customizable-recom-for-michigan"> Python script </a> for quantifying redistricting fairness
      in Michigan and provided feedback to the <a href = "https://www.michigan.gov/micrc/about"> Michigan Independent Citizens Redistricting Commission </a>
        on their initial practice maps.

      Later I became a policy analyst for <a href = "https://closup.umich.edu/"> CLOSUP </a> at the Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy.
      As a policy analyst, I worked with <a href = "https://services.math.duke.edu/~gjh/"> Gregory Herschlag </a> and <a href = "https://services.math.duke.edu/~jonm/"> Jonathan Mattingly</a>,
      processing Michigan geographic shapefiles and election data to apply a modified version of the <a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.08054"> Multi-scale Merge-split </a>
      Markov chain redistricting fairness algorithm. Alongside <a href = "https://sites.google.com/msu.edu/eguia"> Jon X. Eguia</a>,
      I also quantified the fairness of every redistricting plan in the 2022 cycle according to simpler measures, co-authoring the
      <a href = "https://ippsr.msu.edu/partisan-advantage-tracker"> IPPSR Partisan Advantage Tracker </a> and issuing an associated
      <a href = "https://closup.umich.edu/research/student-working-papers/evaluating-outcome-2022-united-states-redistricting-cycle"> policy report</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the summer of 2021, I participated in the <a href= "https://math.williams.edu/small/"> SMALL REU </a> program at Williams College.
        At SMALL I was part of <a href = "https://web.williams.edu/Mathematics/sjmiller/public_html/"> Steven J. Miller's </a> Number Theory
        and Probability Theory group, and I worked on four subprojects spanning discrete geometry, random matrix theory, additive combinatorics, and
        combinatorial game theory. The discrete geometry subproject was co-advised by <a href = "https://personal.math.vt.edu/palsson/">
          Eyvindur A. Palsson </a> and <a href = "https://sites.google.com/view/charleswolf/"> Charles Wolf</a>.
      </p>

      <p>During the summer of 2020, I participated (virtually) in the Extremal Graph Theory and Dynamical Systems REU
      at Rochester Institute of Technology. I studied the existence of efficient $(j,k)$-dominating functions on graphs
       with <a href="https://people.rit.edu/brsma/"> Brendan Rooney</a>.
